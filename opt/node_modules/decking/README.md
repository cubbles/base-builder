# deckingâ€”simplified management for clusters of Docker containers

Decking aims to simplify the creation, organsation and running of clusters
of Docker containers in a way which is familiar to developers; by reading
information from a `decking.json` package file on a project by
project basis.

## Installation

```[sudo] npm install -g decking```

While the project is under development the best place to find
the most up-to-date documentation is [decking.io](http://decking.io).

## Latest Release: 0.4.0

* Add `--as` CLI option to suport arbitrary group aliases
* Add `ready` container parameter to signal when service has started
* No more copying Dockerfiles around when building images
* Fix bad image builds silently exiting leaving 'ghost' containers
* Add `context` image parameter to allow arbitrary build context directories
* Add `--context` CLI option to allow arbitrary runtime build context directories
* `decking create` no longer starts then stops containers (much faster)
* Add support for cpu shares container option
* Add support for memory limit container option
* Much better output for non TTY environments (e.g. CI)
* Much better error handling
* Fix crashing when containers go away while running `decking attach`
* Add `decking destroy` to remove clusters
* Fix container aliases sometimes not being set
